Instructions for Creating an SDSoC Platform using these files:
===================================================================
* FYI, here is where all files come from:
	*/*.bif -- handwritten
	*/lscript.ld -- Generated from a simple helloworld project in sdk with heap and stack increased
	boot_*/fsbl.elf -- Included in the sdk folder of this project.
	include_bsp -- from displaydemo_bsp in sdk folder (currently not used)
	lib -- /usr/lib of the petalinux rootfs. Hope to link directly to petalinux build dir at some point
	include_linux -- /usr/include of the petalinux rootfs. Hope to link directly to petalinux build dir at some point

* When I try to link to the .xpr in the proj folder, it throws an error saying that it can't find the .bd. I'm guessing this is because
  the .bd is remotely located in the ../src/bd folder and it can't find it. For now, I am just manually archiving the project and
  extracting it to SDSoC_Staging/proj_copy/ so that I can point the tool there instead.

* The make file was made using the "sdspfm -gui" command to input all information except the linux libs. The state
  of the GUI tool was then saved as an XML (config.xml) with relative paths and also exported as a makefile. I had to correct the XML and 
  makefile in a text editor when it pointed to ../../proj, but since I am no longer linking to that folder it is not an issue
  (see issue above). I had to modify the makefile to add -force and -prebuilt. If I need to make a change in the GUI, I should load config.xml,
  make the changes, export the makefile again, then make the same manual changes to it. Note there is still no method for providing a lib path.


1) Open a terminal and source /opt/Xilinx/SDx/2017.1/settings64.sh
2) Open project in vivado, archive project, extract to src/others/SDSoC_Staging/proj_copy/
3) cd into src/others/
4) execute make

5) copy the vivado-boards folder included here to output\Arty_Z7_20\hw\vivado\Arty_Z7_20.ipdefs\
6) Open output\Arty_Z7_20\hw\vivado\Arty_Z7_20.xpr in a text editor and change the line below so that it matches:

    <Option Name="BoardPartRepoPaths" Val="$PPRDIR/Arty_Z7_20.ipdefs/vivado-boards/new/board_files"/>
	
7) Save and close the .xpr file
8) If the Vivado IPI project was not changed since the last build you can skip this step. Otherwise you will 
   need to take the platform, build a simple project in SDSoC with it, and copy the files as indicated on page
   23 of ug1146 to the prebuilt folder.
9) Copy the lib folder to the output\Arty_Z7_20\sw\linux\ folder.
10) Open output\Arty_Z7_20\sw\Arty_Z7_20.spfm and replace the following line: 

<sdx:os sdx:name="linux" sdx:displayName="Linux OS" sdx:includePaths="linux/inc/include_linux" />

    with:

<sdx:os sdx:name="linux" sdx:displayName="Linux OS" sdx:includePaths="linux/inc/include_linux" sdx:libraryPaths="linux/lib" />

11) Save and close the file.    

12) The platform is now ready!
