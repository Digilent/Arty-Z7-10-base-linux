Instructions for Creating an SDSoC Platform using these files:
===================================================================
***This will only work on SamB's computer for now due to platform_builder.xml***
***To fix this you need to edit the file and change all abosolute paths      ***

1) Open SDx Terminal 2016.4 (in Windows)
2) cd into a directory with a very short filepath (e.g. "C:/work/temp/")
3) execute sdspfm -gui
4) In the GUI, open the platform_builder.xml project.

* FYI, here is where all files come from:
	boot_*/*.bif -- handwritten
	lscript.ld -- Generated from a simple helloworld project in sdk with heap and stack increased
	boot/fsbl.elf -- Included in the sdk folder of this project.

5) Click Generate
6) copy the vivado-boards folder included here to output\Arty_Z7_20\hw\vivado\Arty_Z7_20.ipdefs\
7) Open output\Arty_Z7_20\hw\vivado\Arty_Z7_20.xpr in a text editor and change the line below so that it matches:

    <Option Name="BoardPartRepoPaths" Val="$PPRDIR/Arty_Z7_20.ipdefs/vivado-boards/new/board_files"/>
	
8) Save and close the .xpr file
9) The platform is now ready!
