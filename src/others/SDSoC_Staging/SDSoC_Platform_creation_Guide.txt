Instructions for Creating an SDSoC Platform using these files:
===================================================================
***This will only work on SamB's computer for now due to platform_builder.xml***
***To fix this you need to edit the file and change all abosolute paths      ***

1) Open SDx Terminal 2016.4 (in Windows)
2) cd into a directory with a very short filepath (e.g. "C:/work/temp/")
3) execute sdspfm -gui
4) In the GUI, open the platform_builder.xml project.

* FYI, here is where all files come from:
	boot_*/*.bif -- handwritten
	lscript.ld -- Generated from a simple helloworld project in sdk with heap and stack increased
	boot/fsbl.elf -- Included in the sdk folder of this project.
	lib_bsp and include_bsp -- from displaydemo_bsp in sdk folder

5) Click Generate
6) copy the vivado-boards folder included here to output\Arty_Z7_20\hw\vivado\Arty_Z7_20.ipdefs\
7) Open output\Arty_Z7_20\hw\vivado\Arty_Z7_20.xpr in a text editor and change the line below so that it matches:

    <Option Name="BoardPartRepoPaths" Val="$PPRDIR/Arty_Z7_20.ipdefs/vivado-boards/new/board_files"/>
	
8) Save and close the .xpr file
9) If the Vivado IPI project was not changed since the last build you can skip this step. Otherwise you will 
   need to take the platform, build a simple project in SDSoC with it, and copy the files as indicated on page
   23 of ug1146 to the prebuilt_platform folder.
10) Copy the prebuilt_platform folder to the output\Arty_Z7_20\sw\ folder.
11) Open output\Arty_Z7_20\sw\Arty_Z7_20.spfm and add the following line before every instance of </sdx:configuration>:

<sdx:prebuilt sdx:data="prebuilt_platform"/>

12) Save and close the file.    

13) The platform is now ready!
